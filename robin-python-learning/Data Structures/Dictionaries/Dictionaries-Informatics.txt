
Dictionaries are unordered mappings for storing objects. 
Previously, we saw how lists store objects in an ordered sequence, dictionary uses Key-Value pair instead.
This Key-Value pair allows users to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location
Dictionary uses curly braces and colons to signify the keys and their associated values.
{'key1':'value1','key2':'value2'}

So, when to choose a list and when to choose a dictionary?
Dictionaries: Objects retrieved by Key name. Unordered and cannot be sorted.
Lists: Objects retrived by location. Ordered sequence can be indexed or sliced.

Do dictionaries keep an order? How do I print the values of dictionary in order?
Dictionaries are mappings and do not retain order! If you do want the capabilities of dictionary but would like ordering as well, check out ordereddict object.
