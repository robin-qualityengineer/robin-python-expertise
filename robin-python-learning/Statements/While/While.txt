While loop will continue to execute a block of code while some conditions remain True.
For example, while my pool is not full, keep filing my pool with water.
Or, while my dogs are still hungry, keep feeding my dogs.

Syntax:
	while some_boolean_condition:
		#do something
	else:
		#do something different

break: Break out of the current closest enclosing loop.
continue: Goes to the top of closest enclosing loop.
pass: Does noting at all
